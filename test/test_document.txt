zkTLS: Building A Verifiable and Private Web

What is zkTLS?

Zero-Knowledge Transport Layer Security combines two cryptographic approaches. TLS provides encryption and authentication for secure data transmission in HTTPS, while zero-knowledge proofs allow one party to prove knowledge of information without revealing it. Together, they enable provable and encrypted data transmission.

The Oasis Protocol is collaborating with leading zkTLS projects, including integration efforts with Reclaim Protocol and Sapphire to enhance data authenticity across their ecosystem.

How It Works

The process involves a TLS handshake establishing a secure session, followed by zkTLS capturing session details and processing them through a zk-SNARK circuit. This generates a proof verifying data authenticity and source while keeping sensitive details hidden. The proof can then be recorded on a blockchain for verification.

Implementation Types

Three primary approaches exist:

- MPC-based: A network of nodes collaboratively creates a multi-party key, ensuring no single party controls the entire encryption key.

- TEE-based: Trusted execution environments handle sensitive data internally, providing cryptographic guarantees about request and response integrity.

- Proxy-based: HTTPS proxies forward encrypted traffic while providing attestations about data exchanges, with the browser generating zero-knowledge proofs.

Why It Matters for Crypto

Verifiability: Traditional TLS lacks proof of data origin or authenticity. zkTLS solves this by making data transfer verifiable while maintaining encryption.

Privacy: Zero-knowledge proofs enable selective disclosure, allowing users to prove claims without exposing unnecessary personal information.

Key Applications

- DeFi lending platforms can verify creditworthiness without exposing account balances
- Identity verification using secure web sources
- Privacy-preserving oracles providing verifiable data feeds
- Verifiable airdrops confirming off-chain eligibility

Important Caveats

zkTLS verifies data state and source but cannot assess truthfulness or context. It represents a partial solution to the oracle problem rather than a complete answer, requiring complementary safeguards like reputation systems and cross-checks for maximum effectiveness.
